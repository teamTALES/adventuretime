# Grading Notes

General
- Everything came together so nicely! The stories were intriguing, and the ending details in the leaderboard is a nice touch.

CSS
- There are some minor spacing and naming issues sprinkled throughout. See files for notes!
- Also, there are a few places where blocks are almost identical. Start getting in the habit of looking for repetition and questioning how we can make things DRY. Across all the code you write, not just CSS.

JS
- Your linter isn't passing! There are some unused variables and trailing spaces in game.js
- Also in regards to eslint: instead of using the disable line comment for a global variable, add it to your config file (eslintrc.json), like we did with Chart.js
- See more notes in individual files.

HTML
- Looks good! There was some messy indentation though, and also a link tag has an unneeded id, with single quotes.
- One suggestion: use more white space! You started in one file, to use it to separate elements and make it easier to read, but could always do more.
